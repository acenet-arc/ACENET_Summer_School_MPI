MPI standards can be found at the <a href="https://www.mpi-forum.org/docs/">MPI Forum</a>.
In particular, the MPI 3.1 standard is laid out in 
<a href="https://www.mpi-forum.org/docs/mpi-3.1/mpi31-report.pdf">this PDF</a>.

The default MPI implementation on Compute Canada clusters is Open MPI.
Manual pages can be found at
<a href="https://www.open-mpi.org/doc/">www.open-mpi.org</a>

The default version of Open MPI may differ from one cluster to another,
but you can find what version and change it with `module` commands.
See <a href="https://docs.computecanada.ca/wiki/Utiliser_des_modules/en">Using modules</a>
at the Compute Canada documentation wiki.

There are online tutorials for learning MPI, including these from:
